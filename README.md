# VoidCode – Lightweight Web Code Editor

VoidCode Monaco — a feature-rich, web-based code editor built on the Monaco engine. Supports multiple languages, syntax highlighting, and advanced editing tools, making it ideal for coding, testing(HTML), and prototyping directly in the browser.

VoidCode is a compact, browser-based code editor built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered internally by the Monaco Editor engine.

It is designed for learners, hobbyists, and developers who want a **fast, portable, low-storage editor** for writing and testing code without installing heavy IDEs.

VoidCode runs entirely on the client side, works offline, and focuses on clarity, control, and direct interaction with code.

⚠️ Note: This project is intentionally minimal and evolving. Features, behaviors, and internal logic may be incomplete or experimental. Bugs and gaps are expected and welcome to be explored.
